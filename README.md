# ORM E-Commerce

ORM E-Commerce is a back end e-commerce website.

## Description

Connect to the database using Sequelize and enter schema and seed commands. This creates a development database and is seeded with data. Then, you will type `npm start` in your terminal to invoke the application. When the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database, you will be able to successfully create, update, and delete data in the database.
